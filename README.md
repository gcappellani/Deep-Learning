# Deep-Learning

This repository contains a personal implementation of the following Deep Learning most used Neural Networks, along with implementations of the most used
Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms. In particular here you can find:

• A simple Feed Forward NN

• Convolutional NN extended in its most general way, with n-dimensional input tensors and kernels. Min/Max and Avg pooling layers have been implemented as well

• An LSTM NN

As for the Deep RL algorithm, here you can find:

• Q Learning
• Deep Q Learning
• Double Deep Q Learning
• Double Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

All of the above have been tested with using the OpenAI gym environments, such as the control and the robotic ones.
